   Jira provides centralized task management to easily organize both what code needs to be written and what bugs need fixing. It is an industry standard tool used in agile development. It allows us to easily track both the time taken to complete specific tasks but also set goals for when certain tasks need to be completed. It provides many integrations to increase productivity including directly syncing with github.
